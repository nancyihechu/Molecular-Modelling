The project develops a Gradient Boosting-based binary classification model to predict carcinogenicity in chemical compounds using data from 5367 observational assays. This computational approach aims to enhance early toxicity screening in drug development, providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional experimental testing.\n
In the realm of pharmaceutical development, the early detection of carcinogenic properties in chemical compounds is critical to ensuring safety and efficacy, while also reducing the time and cost associated with traditional experimental testing. This paper presents a novel in-silico approach using a Gradient Boosting (GBoost)-based binary classification model that predicts the carcinogenic potential of chemical compounds. Trained on a dataset from 5367 observational carcinogenicity assays obtained from the PubChem online chemical repository, this model leverages advancements in computational techniques to predict toxicity based on chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activity. The model's ability to identify carcinogenic compounds early in the drug discovery process not only speeds up the screening procedure but also significantly cuts down on the resources typically required for laboratory-based carcinogenicity assays. Our results demonstrate that the GBoost model provides reliable predictions that could potentially align with the strategic goals of pharmaceutical companies focused on innovative, efficient, and safer drug development. This work suggests a shift towards more predictive and less resource-intensive methods, proposing a significant improvement in how carcinogenicity assessments are conducted in the pharmaceutical industry.
